Fishtris 2
==========

An HTML5 network based Tetris game.

This Tetris clone is based on the code of javascript-tetris
[source](https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-tetris).

Long time ago there was a MS-DOS based Tetris clone called Fishtris.
Two player play tetris. For every row the filled, they got "GNU-Points".

This GNU points can be used to do thinks like:

Number of GNU | Name  |  Effect
--------------|-------|-----------
 3            |Gnubaby|remove a row at the opponent
 6            |Tonne  |send the opponent a tonne
 8            |Blubber|remove 3 rows at the opponent
12            |Ringel |remove a row in your game
15            |Wonne  |the next item will be a tonne
20            |Riegel |remove 3 rows at your game
22            |BigFISH|send the opponent a FISH
24            |Schneck|slow down your game
26            |Bohrer |make holes in the the opponent
30            |OberGNU|make the game of the opponet faster

A tonne is this:

 xxxx

And a FISH is this:

  x x
 x xx
  x x
